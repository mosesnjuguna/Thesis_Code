# Equitable Staffing in Heterogeneous Queueing Systems
*Senior Thesis — Princeton University, Operations Research & Financial Engineering*

This repository contains the code, simulations, and analysis for my undergraduate thesis on equitable staffing in heterogeneous queueing systems.

The thesis develops a queueing-theoretic framework for balancing delay across structurally distinct subsystems — with applications to both gender-partitioned restrooms and regionally-deployed emergency medical services (EMS).

Rather than minimizing delay within each queue independently, this framework proposes equitable staffing rules that account for system-wide constraints and demand heterogeneity.
